# Indian_census_Analysis

SQL analysis of Indian census data.

This data contains many different metrics like population, literacy rate, gender ratio, district, state, growth etc. 

You can see multiple question where I have used  multiple concept sql from subqueries, aggregate function, joins, to window function etc. Some question which required some derived equation are also solved in the analysis file

From this analysis I have gathered many important metrics from the data like seperated literate and illiterate population from total population,previous sensus data, least to most literate district Or state, average statewise growth, average gender ratios etc all these insight can help in to tackle different problems


dataset1 and dataset2 is the datasource for this analysis you can directly import it in mysql
